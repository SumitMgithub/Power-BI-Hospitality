# Power-BI-Hospitality

Greetings and welcome to the AtliQ Grands Revenue Insights project repository! Within this initiative, I've harnessed the power of Power BI for data analytics, equipping AtliQ Grands with the capability to make informed choices based on data, outperform rivals in the market, and foster growth in key areas such as market share and revenue.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

AtliQ Grands operates a chain of five-star hotels located throughout India and has a 20-year history in the hospitality industry. However, they are currently experiencing a decline in both market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotel sector due to competition from rivals and ineffective management decisions. To address this situation, the managing director of AtliQ Grands is pursuing a strategic plan to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations with the goal of regaining market share and increasing revenue.

2. Construct a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Generate insightful information that goes beyond what is outlined in the metric list and the mock-up dashboard.
