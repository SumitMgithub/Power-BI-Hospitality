Greetings and welcome to the AtliQ Grands Revenue Insights project repository! Within this initiative, I've harnessed the power of Power BI for data analytics, equipping AtliQ Grands with the capability to make informed choices based on data, outperform rivals in the market, and foster growth in key areas such as market share and revenue.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

AtliQ Grands operates a chain of five-star hotels located throughout India and has a 20-year history in the hospitality industry. However, they are currently experiencing a decline in both market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotel sector due to competition from rivals and ineffective management decisions. To address this situation, the managing director of AtliQ Grands is pursuing a strategic plan to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations with the goal of regaining market share and increasing revenue.\

**BUSINESS MATRICES USED**

1. Average Daily Rate (ADR): ADR signifies the average price charged for each room per day. It's computed by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.

2. Occupancy Percentage (%): This metric calculates the ratio of occupied rooms to the total available rooms, serving as a critical performance indicator.

3. Revenue: Revenue encompasses the total income generated by the hotel, including earnings from room bookings, dining services, and events.

4. RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether occupied or not. It aids hotels in assessing their revenue-generating performance for accurate room pricing. RevPAR also enables comparisons with other properties or brands.

5. Average Rating: The average rating is the mean score or rating given by guests based on their stay experience, often sourced from guest reviews and surveys.

6. No Show Rate (%): This metric reveals the percentage of guests who make reservations but do not arrive at the hotel as scheduled.

7. Daily Booked Room Night (DBRN): DBRN indicates, on average, how many rooms are booked for a specific day within a given timeframe.

8. Daily Sellable Room Night (DSRN): DSRN represents, on average, how many rooms are available for sale on a particular day within a specified period.

9. Daily Utilized Room Night (DURN): DURN denotes, on average, how many rooms are effectively utilized by customers for a given day during a specific timeframe.

10. Realization (%): Realization is the percentage of successfully "checked-out" bookings out of all the reservations made.
